### Git Lab Practice

This is used for hands-on practice with core Git workflows.

* **Branching & Merging:** Created and managed separate branches.
* **Merge Conflicts:** Deliberately created conflicts to understand the process.
* **Conflict Resolution:** Used P4Merge to visually resolve a conflict.
* **History Cleanup:** Deleted a merged branch to keep the repository clean.
